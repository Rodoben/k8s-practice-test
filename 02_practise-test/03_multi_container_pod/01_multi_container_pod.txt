Question:

Create a YAML manifest for a pod named compalex-pod.The main application container named app should use the image nginx  and expose the container at port 80.
Modify the yaml so that the pod uses an init container named setup that uses image busybox, the container run wget -O- www.google.com

Create a pod from the YAML manifest

Download the logs of the init container. you should see the output of the wget command 

open an interactive sheel for the main container and list down the content ls 

force delete the pod.

Create a YAML manifest for a pod named data-exchange. The main application container named main-app should use the image busybox.
The container runs a command that writes a new file every 30 seconds in an infinite loop in directory /var/app/data. The filename follows the pattern {counter++}-data.txt.
The variable counter is incremented every interval and starts with the value of 1

Modify the YAML manifest by adding a sidecar named sidecar. The sidecar container uses the imafe of a busybox and runs a command that counts the number of files produced bu the main-app container every 30 second in an infinite loop. The Command write the number of files to standard output.

Deffine a volume of type emptydir. Mount the path /var/app/data fot both containers.

Create the pod. Tail the logs of the sidecar container
Delete the pod.

  name: <container_name>
  command:
  - wget
  - "-O-"
  - 'www.google.com"

kubectl logs complex-pod -c setup
kubectl exec -it  complex-pod -c main -- bin/sh
