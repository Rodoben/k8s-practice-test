(Question)
You are required to create a pod that requests a certain amount of CPU and memory, so it gets scheduled to-a node that has those resources available.

Create a pod named pod-resources in the resources namespace that requests a minimum of 300m CPU and 1Gi memory for its container

The pod should use the nginx image

Check if the resources namespace has already been created



kubectl run pod pod-resources --image=nginx --requests=cpu=300m,memory=1Gi -n resources
