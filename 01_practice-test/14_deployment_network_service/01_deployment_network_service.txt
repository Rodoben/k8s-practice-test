Question:

Create a service named myapp of type clusterIP that exposes port 80 to the target port 80.
Create a deployment named myapp that creates 1 replicas running the image nginx. Expose the container on port 80

Verify port 80 is exposed - list the endpoint values

scale the deployment to 2 replicas

Create a temporary pod using the image busybox ad run wget command against the IP address of the service.

Change the service type so the pods can be reached from outside of the cluster

Run wget command against the service from outside the cluster.



Solution:

kubectl create svc  clusterip myapp --tcp=80:80

kubectl create deployment myapp --image=nginx --replicas=1

kubectl scale deployment myapp --replicas=2
