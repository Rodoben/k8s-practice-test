THe deployment uses the label tier=backend.The pod should use the label app=v1

list the deployment to ensure that the correct numbers of  replicas  are running 

update the image to nginx:latest

verify the change has been rolled out to all the replicas 

scale the deployment to 5 replicas

have a look at the deployment history 

revert the deploymen to revision 1

Solution:

kubectl create deploy deploy --image=nginx --replicas=3 --dry-run=client -o yaml > deploy.yaml

add a label tier-backend to the deployment label inside metadata

add app=v1 to pod level and container level inside metadata

kubctl set image deployment/deploy nginx=nginx:latest


kubectl scale deployment deploy --replicas=5

kubectl rollout history deployment/deploy

kubectl rollout undo deployment/deploy --to-revision=1
