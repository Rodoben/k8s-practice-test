Question 5

Create a resource quota named app under the namespace rq-demo
use a file named rq.yaml 

create a new pod that exceeds the limits of the resource quota be definig 1G of memory. note the error

change the request limits to fulfil the requirements to ensure that the pod can be created successfully.


Solution:

kubectl create ns rq-demo

kubectl create quota app --hard=cpu=1,memory=500m,pods=2 -n rq-demo --dry-run=client -o yaml > rq5.yaml


kubectl run highpod --image=nginx --dry-run=client -n rq-demo -o yaml > pod.yaml

under the container 

spec: 
 container:
 - name: high-priority
   image: <image_name>
   resources:
     requests:
       memory: "1Gi"
       cpu: "500m"
    limits:
      memory: "1Gi"
      cpu: "500m

now decrease the number for requesting and re run the pod again.
